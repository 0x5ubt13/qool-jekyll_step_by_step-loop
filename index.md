## Hello world!

This site is meant to guide you through the basics of Jekyll. It is based on the template webpage, with the minima theme. Please visit the tutorial under Blog to see how you can customize the template webpage, add a new theme and a navigation.

## Navigation style
There are five ways to handle styles. Four of them are shown in the file *_includes/navigation.html*. Because we use the default layout in the gem *jekyll-theme-hacker*, we have no access to the `<head>` tag. To get access we would have to copy/paste its source code into this webpage directly. But since we have the other four ways to do it, that won't usually be necessary.
 
1. from gem jekyll-theme-hacker, via a link in its default layout `<head>` tag 
2. from classes in file assets/css/main.scss as link
3. from classes in file assets/css/main2.scss as import in style tags below
4. from classes in style tags below
5. from inline style attributes style="attribute:value"
